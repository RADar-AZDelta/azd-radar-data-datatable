# svelte-radar-datatable

Why yet another datatable component?
During the development of [Keun](https://github.com/RADar-AZDelta/Keun), we needed a datatable component that could handle CSV's with more than 100.000 rows.
We didn't find anything that suited our needs, so we developed our own.

## Setup for development

Run these commands to get started:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RADar-AZDelta/svelte-radar-datatable.git
cd svelte-radar-datatable
pnpm install
```

To run the example app, run `pnpm run dev --open` from the project root.
